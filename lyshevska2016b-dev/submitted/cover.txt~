Dear Professor A. Stein,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled "Grid spacing and the quality of abundance maps for species that show spatial correlation and zero-inflation" to your journal "Spatial Statistics".

The work combines a generalised linear geostatistical modelling approach and ecological survey data to estimate the effect of grid-spacing on the quality of species abundance maps. 
Our aim in writing this work coincides with the scope of the journal "Spatial Statistics" - we wish to provide an insight into the important spatial issue grid-spacing and the quality of the predictions when the data is spatially autocorreleated and zero-inflated. The application can be readily extended to any species that demonstrate similar distributional properties which will facilitate uptake of the method by the ecologists. 

Legal Statements: 
The manuscript we are submitting reports our original work and has not been published previously and is not presently submitted elsewhere. 
Publication is explicitly approved by all the authors and tacitly by our employers - Royal Netherlands Institute for Sea Research and Wageningen UR. 
If accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of the copyright-holder. 
We have no conflicts of interest, including no financial, personal or other relationships with other people or organisations. 
The work was desk-based and supported financially by a WaLTER project (http://www.walterwaddenmonitor.org)

We are very grateful for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
