abstract = "Using spatial simulated annealing (SSA), spatial sampling schemes can be optimised for minimal kriging variance. Two optimisation criteria are presented in this paper. The first criterion minimises the average kriging variance, the second the maximum kriging variance. In a simple case with 23 observations, performances of a sampling scheme obtained with \{SSA\} were compared with performances of a triangular grid. \{SSA\} reduced the average kriging variance from 40.64 to 39.99 [unit]2. The maximum kriging variance was reduced from 86.83 to 53.36 [unit]2. Starting with a preliminary, irregularly data set of 100 observations, an additional sampling scheme of 10 observations was optimised. This reduced the average kriging variance from 21.62 to 15.83 [unit]2. The maximum kriging variance was reduced from 70.22 to 34.60 [unit]2. As the kriging variance is considerably influenced by variogram parameters, their influence on the optimised sampling schemes was investigated. A Gaussian variogram produced a different sampling scheme than an exponential variogram with the same nugget, sill and (effective) range. Exponential, spherical and linear variograms without nugget resulted in irregular similar sampling schemes. A very short range resulted in irregular sampling schemes, with observations separated by distances larger than twice the range. For a spherical variogram, the magnitude of the relative nugget effect did not affect the sampling schemes, except for very high values (0.75). "

abstract = "Species distribution models use small samples to produce continuous distribution maps. The question of how small a sample can be to produce an accurate model generally has been answered based on comparisons to maximum sample sizes of 200 observations or fewer. In addition, model comparisons often are made with the kappa statistic, which has become controversial. Therefore, we used sample sizes ranging from 30 to 2500 individuals to model 16 tree species or species groups in Minnesota's Laurentian Mixed Forest. We compared all smaller sample sizes to models for 2500 records and then 1000 records using Cohen's kappa, Pearson's r, Cronbach's alpha, and two intraclass correlation coefficients. We then began confirmation of our findings by repeating the process using a smaller extent in a different area, a portion of Missouri's Central Hardwoods. Although there are disadvantages to using the kappa statistic and intraclass correlation coefficients, due to conversion to categories or computation limitations respectively, the model comparison metrics produced similar results. Comparison values depend on the maximum sample size, and at sample sizes roughly around 10–20\% of the maximum sample size, values will begin to decrease more rapidly. Models may not be very accurate below a sample size of 200, for our study areas, extents, and grains. Nonetheless, models based on small sample sizes still may provide information for rare species. We recommend using the full sample available for modeling, after using a partial sample for accuracy assessment. Future research is needed to confirm our findings for different areas, extents, grains, and species. "

Because, sampling species’ distributions is costly, we explored sample size needs for accurate modeling for three predictive modeling methods via re-sampling of data for well-sampled species, and developed curves of model improvement with increasing sample size. In general, under a coarse surrogate model, and machine-learning methods, average success rate at predicting occurrence of a species at a location, or accuracy, was 90\% of maximum within ten sample points, and was near maximal at 50 data points. However, a fine surrogate model and logistic regression model had significantly lower rates of increase in accuracy with increasing sample size, reaching similar maximum accuracy at 100 data points. The choice of environmental variables also produced unpredictable effects on accuracy over the range of sample sizes on the logistic regression method, while the machine-learning method had robust performance throughout. Examining correlates of model performance across species, extent of geographic distribution was the only significant ecological factor. "

abstract={A key requirement for informed marine-zone management is an understanding of the spatial patterns of marine biodiversity, often measured as species richness, total abundance or presence of key taxa. In the present study, we focussed on the diversity of benthic infauna and applied a predictive modelling approach to map biodiversity patterns for three study sites on the tropical Carnarvon shelf of Western Australia. A random forest decision tree model was used to generate spatial predictions of two measures of infaunal diversity, namely, species richness and total abundance. Results explained between 20\% and 37\% of the variance of each measure. The modelling process also identified potential physical surrogates for species richness and abundance, with sediment physical properties ranked as most important across the study region. Specifically, coarse-grained heterogeneous sediments were associated with higher infaunal species richness and total abundance. Seabed topographic properties were also important at the local scale. The study demonstrated the value of a surrogacy approach to the prediction of biodiversity patterns, particularly when the number of biological samples was limited. Such an approach may facilitate an understanding of ecosystem processes in the region and contribute to integrated marine management.},

     abstract = {1. In order to predict the spatial distribution of `ideal' and `free' predators, one needs to know how food intake rate of an individual predator is related to characteristics of the population of the prey as well as the predators themselves. 2. Surprisingly, a systematic theoretical investigation of models for the basic case, where both prey and predators are best characterized by their `standing stock' density, is lacking. In these models intake rate is supposed to decrease with increasing predator density as a result of interference among predators, instead of immediate consumption of the prey. 3. This paper compares the various ways applied so far of incorporating interference in Holling's functional response model. It is shown that the different models of interference result in qualitatively different predictions for `ideal' and `free' predators on: (i) the form of the aggregative response; (ii) the trajectory of the aggregative response as prey is depleted; and (iii) the change in the aggregative response following an influx of predators. This sheds doubt on the general relevance of any one of these models, particularly if the mathematical formulation of interference is phenomenological and merely based on convention, instead of being derived from the underlying mechanism of interactions between predators. 4. Our results underline the need for detailed knowledge about the components of the predation process in order to arrive at predictions for a specific case.},

The word inflation is used to emphasize that the probability mass at the point zero exceeds that allowed under a standard parametric family of distributions. Zero-inflated data are abundant in many disciplines, including the environmental sciences. If not properly modeled, the presence of excess zeros can invalidate the distributional assumptions of the analysis, jeopardizing the integrity of the scientific inferences. The zeros can also create many computational difficulties. Recently, a fair amount of interest has concentrated on the analysis of zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) counts. Strictly speaking, however, the data need not follow a Poisson distribution in order to be zero inflated. In this article, a broader definition of the subject is taken; zero inflation is considered as a practical data phenomenon that can be associated with any parametric family of distributions.},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need to predict ecological responses to long-term
   habitat change. However, statistical models for marine soft-substratum
   ecosystems are limited, and consequently there is a need for the
   development of such models. In order to assess the utility of
   statistical modelling approaches for predicting likely changes in
   species distributions under varying environmental conditions, we tested
   the utility of logistic modelling and classification approaches. We
   successfully developed models relating the presence/absence of common
   intertidal macrofauna to changing environmental variables such as
   sediment characteristics, depth/elevation, tidal currents and wind-wave
   (i.e. wind-generated wave activity) disturbance. The final model for
   each species contained between 1 and 6 variables, where the percentage
   correctly predicted was moderate to high, ranging from 59 to 97 \%. We
   were also able to identify relationships between higher level variables
   such as estuary type, basin morphometry and catchment-draining processes
   in driving macrobenthic community composition; however, we were unable
   to fully test the utility of the classification approach due to
   differences in the scale at which the macrobenthic data was collected
   and the scale of the higher level physical variables. These models were
   developed and tested using data that covered a range of environmental
   conditions in 5 estuaries in New Zealand. Such broad-scale statistical
   models play a critical role in our understanding of the likely effects
   of large-scale habitat change. However, a greater understanding of the
   fine-scale mechanistic controls on species distributions such as
   life-history characteristics, density information and biotic
   interactions would potentially lead to the development of more sensitive
   models.}},

Recent advances in SDMs allow us to potentially forecast anthropogenic effects on patterns of biodiversity at different spatial scales. However, some limitations still preclude the use of SDMs in many theoretical and practical applications. Here, we provide an overview of recent advances in this field, discuss the ecological principles and assumptions underpinning SDMs, and highlight critical limitations and decisions inherent in the construction and evaluation of SDMs. Particular emphasis is given to the use of SDMs for the assessment of climate change impacts and conservation management issues. We suggest new avenues for incorporating species migration, population dynamics, biotic interactions and community ecology into SDMs at multiple spatial scales. Addressing all these issues requires a better integration of SDMs with ecological theory.},

This is commonly done by plotting known species occurrences, expert-drawn range maps or geographical estimations derived from species distribution models. However, all three kinds of maps are implicitly subject to uncertainty, due to the quality and bias of raw distributional data, the process of map building, and the dynamic nature of species distributions themselves. Here we review the main sources of uncertainty suggesting a code of good practices in order to minimize their effects. Specifically, we claim that uncertainty should be always explicitly taken into account and we propose the creation of maps of ignorance to provide information on where the mapped distributions are reliable and where they are uncertain.},

abstract = {Distribution models are used to predict the likelihood of occurrence or abundance of a species at locations where census data are not available. An integral part of modelling is the testing of model performance. We compared different schemes and measures for testing model performance using 79 species from the North American Breeding Bird Survey. The four testing schemes we compared featured increasing independence between test and training data: resubstitution, random data hold-out and two spatially segregated data hold-out designs. The different testing measures also addressed different levels of information content in the dependent variable: regression R2 for absolute abundance, squared correlation coefficient r2 for relative abundance and AUC/Somer’s D for presence/absence. We found that higher levels of independence between test and training data lead to lower assessments of prediction accuracy. Even for data collected independently, spatial autocorrelation leads to dependence between random hold-out test data and training data, and thus to inflated measures of model performance. While there is a general awareness of the importance of autocorrelation to model building and hypothesis testing, its consequences via violation of independence between training and testing data have not been addressed systematically and comprehensively before. Furthermore, increasing information content (from correctly classifying presence/absence, to predicting relative abundance, to predicting absolute abundance) leads to decreasing predictive performance. The current tests for presence/absence distribution models are typically overly optimistic because a) the test and training data are not independent and b) the correct classification of presence/absence has a relatively low information content and thus capability to address ecological and conservation questions compared to a prediction of abundance. Meaningful evaluation of model performance requires testing on spatially independent data, if the intended application of the model is to predict into new geographic or climatic space, which arguably is the case for most applications of distribution models.},

abstract = {Species distribution models are usually evaluated with cross-validation. In this procedure evaluation statistics are computed from model predictions for sites of presence and absence that were not used to train (fit) the model. Using data for 226 species, from six regions, and two species distribution modeling algorithms (Bioclim and MaxEnt), I show that this procedure is highly sensitive to ?spatial sorting bias?: the difference between the geographic distance from testing-presence to training-presence sites and the geographic distance from testing-absence (or testing-background) to training-presence sites. I propose the use of pairwise distance sampling to remove this bias, and the use of a null model that only considers the geographic distance to training sites to calibrate cross-validation results for remaining bias. Model evaluation results (AUC) were strongly inflated: the null model performed better than MaxEnt for 45\% and better than Bioclim for 67\% of the species. Spatial sorting bias and area under the receiver?operator curve (AUC) values increased when using partitioned presence data and random-absence data instead of independently obtained presence?absence testing data from systematic surveys. Pairwise distance sampling removed spatial sorting bias, yielding null models with an AUC close to 0.5, such that AUC was the same as null model calibrated AUC (cAUC). This adjustment strongly decreased AUC values and changed the ranking among species. Cross-validation results for different species are only comparable after removal of spatial sorting bias and/or calibration with an appropriate null model

SAC is starting to be considered in the analysis of species distribution data, and over the last 10 years several studies have incorporated SAC into statistical models (here termed ‘spatial models’). Here, I address the question of whether incorporating SAC affects estimates of model coefficients and inference from statistical models.Methods  I review ecological studies that compare spatial and non-spatial models.Results  In all cases coefficient estimates for environmental correlates of species distributions were affected by SAC, leading to a mis-estimation of on average c. 25\%. Model fit was also improved by incorporating SAC.Main conclusions  These biased estimates and incorrect model specifications have implications for predicting species occurrences under changing environmental conditions. Spatial models are therefore required to estimate correctly the effects of environmental drivers on species present distributions, for a statistically unbiased identification of the drivers of distribution, and hence for more accurate forecasts of future distributions.},

     abstract = {Models of the geographic distributions of species have wide application in ecology. But the nonspatial, single-level, regression models that ecologists have often employed do not deal with problems of irregular sampling intensity or spatial dependence, and do not adequately quantify uncertainty. We show here how to build statistical models that can handle these features of spatial prediction and provide richer, more powerful inference about species niche relations, distributions, and the effects of human disturbance. We begin with a familiar generalized linear model and build in additional features, including spatial random effects and hierarchical levels. Since these models are fully specified statistical models, we show that it is possible to add complexity without sacrificing interpretability. This step-by-step approach, together with attached code that implements a simple, spatially explicit, regression model, is structured to facilitate self-teaching. All models are developed in a Bayesian framework. We assess the performance of the models by using them to predict the distributions of two plant species (Proteaceae) from South Africa's Cape Floristic Region. We demonstrate that making distribution models spatially explicit can be essential for accurately characterizing the environmental response of species, predicting their probability of occurrence, and assessing uncertainty in the model results. Adding hierarchical levels to the models has further advantages in allowing human transformation of the landscape to be taken into account, as well as additional features of the sampling process.},

Based on the generalized information criterion, the \{ZINB\} regression model provided a better fit to the data than either Poisson, negative binomial or zero-inflated Poisson regression models. To demonstrate the utility of the \{ZINB\} regression model for the standardization of catch data, standardized temporal trends in bycatch rates estimated with the \{ZINB\} regression model are computed and compared to those obtained from fits of the other three types of models to the same data. With the exception of the negative binomial, estimated temporal trends were more similar among models than would have been inferred from an analysis of model fit. Comparison of trends among models suggests that the negative binomial regression model may overestimate model coefficients when fitted to data with many zero-valued observations. "

The data used for the modelling exercise consisted of regular winter counts of shorebirds in one hundred and five 50×50 m plots, arranged in a 1050×250 m area. Several physical characteristics were obtained from each plot and some other variables were derived using a Geographical Information System (GIS). These variables were used to predict the probability of occurrence of shorebirds using GAMs. The three most influential variables in the distribution of the shorebird species assemblage were the distance to channels, type of sediment and area of oyster beds. The smooth response curves of the species occurrence along the gradient of the variables were biologically meaningful, and generally consistent with previous descriptions of the habitat preferences of each species. The quality of the fits was generally very high, as assessed by the significance of the models and by comparing the observed frequencies with the predicted probabilities of occurrence. The performance of \{GAMs\} was compared with that of the equivalent GLMs, and we concluded that extended flexibility offered by \{GAMs\} resulted in better overall fits. We suggest that \{GAMs\} represent a convenient framework for modelling the large-scale distribution of shorebirds in intertidal areas from their physical characteristics. "

     abstract = {Sophisticated statistical analyses are common in ecological research, particularly in species distribution modeling. The effects of sometimes arbitrary decisions during the modeling procedure on the final outcome are difficult to assess, and to date are largely unexplored. We conducted an analysis quantifying the contribution of uncertainty in each step during the model-building sequence to variation in model validity and climate change projection uncertainty. Our study system was the distribution of the Great Grey Shrike in the German federal state of Saxony. For each of four steps (data quality, collinearity method, model type, and variable selection), we ran three different options in a factorial experiment, leading to 81 different model approaches. Each was subjected to a fivefold cross-validation, measuring area under curve (AUC) to assess model quality. Next, we used three climate change scenarios times three precipitation realizations to project future distributions from each model, yielding 729 projections. Again, we analyzed which step introduced most variability (the four model-building steps plus the two scenario steps) into predicted species prevalences by the year 2050. Predicted prevalences ranged from a factor of 0.2 to a factor of 10 of present prevalence, with the majority of predictions between 1.1 and 4.2 (inter-quartile range). We found that model type and data quality dominated this analysis. In particular, artifical neural networks yielded low cross-validation robustness and gave very conservative climate change predictions. Generalized linear and additive models were very similar in quality and predictions, and superior to neural networks. Variations in scenarios and realizations had very little effect, due to the small spatial extent of the study region and its relatively small range of climatic conditions. We conclude that, for climate projections, model type and data quality were the most influential factors. Since comparison of model types has received good coverage in the ecological literature, effects of data quality should now come under more scrutiny.},

Stone pine (Pinus pinea L.) is one of the main species in the Mediterranean basin that is able to grow under hard limiting conditions (sandy soils and extreme continental climate), and typically defined as a masting species. Considering the high economical value associated with edible nut production, the masting habit of stone pine has been a main concern for the forest management of the species. In the present work we have used annual fruit data series from 740 stone pine trees measured during a 13 years period (1996–2008) in order: (a) to verify our main hypothesis pointing out to the existence of a weather control of the fruiting process in limiting environments, rather than resource depletion or endogenous inherent cycles; (b) to identify those site factors, stand attributes and climate events affecting specific traits involved in fruiting process; and (c) to construct a model for predicting spatial and temporal patterns of variability in stone pine cone production at different spatial extents as region, stand and tree. Given the nature of the data, the model has been formulated as zero-inflated log-normal, incorporating random components to carry out with the observed lack of independence. This model attains efficiencies close to 70–80\% in predicting temporal and spatial variability at regional scale. Though efficiencies are reduced according to the spatial extent of the model, it leads to unbiased estimates and efficiencies over 35–50\% when predicting annual yields at tree or stand scale, respectively. In this sense, the proposed model is a main tool for facilitating decision making in some management aspects such as the quantification of total amount of cones annually supplied to nut industry, design of cone harvest programs or the optimal application of seedling felling.

The approach in this paper extends previous work to incorporate the use of Generalized Additive Models (GAM) in the modelling steps. The paper develops the link and variance functions needed for the use of \{GAM\} with zero inflated data.

For this class of models the main second-order properties of the count variables are derived, and three models within this class are studied in some detail. It is shown that for this class of models there is a close connection between the correlation structure of the counts and their overdispersions, and this property can be used to explore the flexibility of the correlation structures of these models. It is suggested that the models in this class may not be adequate to represent data consisting mostly of small counts with substantial spatial correlation. Three geostatistical count datasets are used to illustrate these issues and suggest how the results might be used to guide the selection of a model within this class. "

abstract = "Knowledge about the spatial distribution of seabirds at sea is important for conservation. During marine conservation planning, logistical constraints preclude seabird surveys covering the complete area of interest and spatial distribution of seabirds is frequently inferred from predictive statistical models. Increasingly complex models are available to relate the distribution and abundance of pelagic seabirds to environmental variables, but a comparison of their usefulness for delineating protected areas for seabirds is lacking. Here we compare the performance of five modelling techniques (generalised linear models, generalised additive models, Random Forest, boosted regression trees, and maximum entropy) to predict the distribution of Balearic Shearwaters (Puffinus mauretanicus) along the coast of the western Iberian Peninsula. We used ship transect data from 2004 to 2009 and 13 environmental variables to predict occurrence and density, and evaluated predictive performance of all models using spatially segregated test data. Predicted distribution varied among the different models, although predictive performance varied little. An ensemble prediction that combined results from all five techniques was robust and confirmed the existence of marine important bird areas for Balearic Shearwaters in Portugal and Spain. Our predictions suggested additional areas that would be of high priority for conservation and could be proposed as protected areas. Abundance data were extremely difficult to predict, and none of five modelling techniques provided a reliable prediction of spatial patterns. We advocate the use of ensemble modelling that combines the output of several methods to predict the spatial distribution of seabirds, and use these predictions to target separate surveys assessing the abundance of seabirds in areas of regular use.

abstract = {1. An important question in macroecology is: Can we estimate a species’ abundance from its occurrence on landscape? Answers to this question are useful for estimating population size from more easily acquired distribution data and for understanding the macroecological occupancy–abundance relationship.2. Several methods have recently been developed to address this question, but no method is general enough to provide a common solution to all species because of the wide variation in spatial distribution of species.3. In this study, we developed a mixed Gamma-Poisson model that generalizes the negative binomial model and can characterize spatial dependence in the abundance distribution across cells. Under this framework, without any extra information, the clumping parameter and species abundance can be estimated using a map aggregation technique. This model was tested using a set of empirical census data consisting of 299 tree species from a 50-ha stem-mapped plot of Panama.4. A comparison showed that the new method outperformed the previous methods to an appreciable degree. Particularly for abundant species in a finely gridded map (5 × 5 m), its bias is very small and the method can also reduce the root mean square error up to 30\%. Like for previous methods, however, the new method’s performance decreases with the increase in cell size.5. As a by-product, the new method provides an approach to estimate spatial autocorrelation of species distribution which is otherwise difficult to estimate for presence/absence map.},

abstract = { Generalized linear spatial models (GLSM) are used here to study spatial characters of zoonotic cutaneous leishmaniasis (ZCL) in Tunisia. The response variable stands for the number of affected by district during the period 2001–2002. The model covariates are: climates (temperature and rainfall), humidity and surrounding vegetation status. As the environmental and weather data are not available for all the studied districts, Kriging based on linear interpolation was used to estimate the missing data. To account for unexplained spatial variation in the model, we include a stationary Gaussian process S with a powered exponential spatial correlation function. Moran coefficient, DIC criterion and residuals variograms are used to show the high goodness-of-fit of the GLSM. When compared with the statistical tools used in the previous ZCL studies, the optimal GLSM found here yields a better assessment of the impact of the risk factors, a better prediction of ZCL evolution and a better comprehension of the disease transmission. The statistical results show the progressive increase in the number of affected in zones with high temperature, low rainfall and high surrounding vegetation index. Relative humidity does not seem to affect the distribution of the disease in Tunisia. The results of the statistical analyses stress the important risk of misleading epidemiological conclusions when non-spatial models are used to analyse spatially structured data. }

The response from each child is a binary indicator of the presence of malarial parasites in a blood sample. The model includes terms for the effects of child level covariates (age and bed net use), village level covariates (inclusion or exclusion from the primary health care system and greenness of surrounding vegetation as derived from satellite information) and separate components for residual spatial and non-spatial extrabinomial variation. The results confirm and quantify the progressive increase in prevalence with age, and the protective effects of bed nets. They also show that the extrabinomial variation is spatially structured, suggesting an environmental effect rather than variation in familial susceptibility. Neither inclusion in the primary health care system nor the greenness of the surrounding vegetation appeared to affect the prevalence of malaria. The method of inference was Bayesian using vague priors and a Markov chain Monte Carlo implementation.},

However, characterizing spatial distribution of wild animals such as fin whales is a major priority to protect these populations and to study their interactions with their environment. We have associated a geostatistical model with the Poisson distribution to model both spatial variation and discrete observation process. Assuming few weak hypotheses on the distribution of abundance, we have improved the experimental variogram estimate using weights that are derived from expected variances and proposed a bias correction that accounts for the variability added by the Poisson observation process. In the same way the kriging system was modified to interpolate directly the theoretical underlying animal abundance better than noisy observations from count data. For cumulative count data of fin whales over the summers 1993–2001, the method gave a map of the relative abundance which is informative on the spatial patterns. Kriging interpolation variances were dramatically reduced – ratio from 0.015 to 0.26 – compared to usual Ordinary Kriging on raw data. Adding the hypothesis of stationarity over time the variogram estimated on cumulative data can be then used with more sparser annual data. "

In a ZIP model, a count response variable is assumed to be distributed as a mixture of a Poisson(λ) distribution and a distribution with point mass of one at zero, with mixing probability p. Both p and λ are allowed to depend on covariates through canonical link generalized linear models. In this paper, we adapt Lambert's methodology to an upper bounded count situation, thereby obtaining a zero-inflated binomial (ZIB) model. In addition, we add to the flexibility of these fixed effects models by incorporating random effects so that, e.g., the within-subject correlation and between-subject heterogeneity typical of repeated measures data can be accommodated. We motivate, develop, and illustrate the methods described here with an example from horticulture, where both upper bounded count (binomial-type) and unbounded count (Poisson-type) data with excess zeros were collected in a repeated measures designed experiment.},

abstract = "Abstract The Wadden Sea is a shallow coastal region, with a large area of sedimentary tidal flats that extends from The Netherlands to Denmark and has been declared a site of international importance in the Dutch and German parts (Ramsar status and \{UNESCO\} World Heritage Site). Benthic macrofauna are central to the ecosystem functioning of this area, as they recycle nutrients, decompose organic matter and are an important food source for many secondary consumers, like fish and waterbirds. Due to the environmental gradients characteristic of estuarine systems, it is expected that changes in assemblage composition will be observed across the physical and environmental gradients of the Wadden Sea. First, we explored the spatial variation in assemblage composition of benthic macrofauna across the intertidal part of the Dutch Wadden Sea using 3&#xa0;years of biomass data. Then, we identified the relative importance of six environmental variables for explaining and predicting changes in assemblage composition across the intertidal areas of the Wadden Sea using generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM). In accordance with the environmental gradients across this system, the biomass contributed by a few common species differed from west to east and were distinct in the Dollard. In the west, bivalves Mya arenaria, Cerastoderma edule and Ensis directus contributed a relatively large and equal share of the total biomass, whereas C. edule contributed the sole largest share of the total biomass towards the east. The polychaete Alitta succinea became a large share of the total biomass in the upper Ems and in the Dollard estuary, but contributed little elsewhere. Similar to the observed differences in species composition, the spatial patterns in assemblage composition, as predicted by the \{GDM\} models, identified the Dollard as distinct and that the prevalence of assemblage types in the west differed to the east. Median grain size, followed by microphytobenthic biomass, and exposure time were the most important variables describing differences in assemblage composition. That the Wadden Sea forms a heterogeneous landscape where assemblage composition varies across multiple gradients has repercussions for management and monitoring. "

In total 41 species were observed at a total sampled area of 44 m2. Individual transects (0.45 m2) yielded 3 to 20 species, with an average of 11.3 species (confidence limits 10.6 and 12.0). The estimates found were evaluated spatially by calculation of weighted means (as to sediment composition and zonation), and temporally by sampling a limited number of stations during 6 years. Only 6 species, viz. Mytilus edulis, Arenicola marina, Mya arenaria, Cerastoderma edule, and Macoma balthica, made up 90\% of the total macrozoobenthic biomass. Suspension feeders dominated with 55\% and were found to live mostly strongly aggregated (e.g. musselbanks). Deposit feeders made up 40\% of the total biomass and were distributed more evenly. Biomass was found to increase steeply with species density over most of the range of species densities observed. Transects located at extreme levels in the intertidal zone or at extreme silt contents of the sediment yielded low estimates of both biomass and species richness. It is concluded that adverse abiotic conditions, rather than primary production or food density, limit the occurrence of species and in that way biomass in most of the Wadden Sea. "

     abstract = {There appears to be a general relationship between abundance and distribution that has two parts. First, within species, population density tends to be greatest in the center of the range and to decline gradually toward the boundaries. This pattern holds over a range of spatial scales from steep environmental gradients within local regions to the entire geographic range. Exceptions include: (1) abrupt changes in abundance that usually correspond to sharp, discontinuous changes in single environmental variables; and (2) multimodal patterns of abundance that are caused by environmental patchiness. The second general relationship is that among closely related, ecologically similar species spatial distribution is positively correlated with average abundance. Again this pattern holds over a variety of spatial scales from local regions to entire geographic ranges. These empirical patterns have already been reported in the literature, but their generality is demonstrated by analysis of additional data for diverse kinds of organisms. A single general theory accounts for these observations and follows logically from three assumptions. First, the abundance and distribution of each species are limited by the combination of physical and biotic environmental variables that determines the multidimensional niche. Second, spatial variation in these environmental variables is somewhat stochastic but autocorrelated, so that nearby sites tend to have more similar environmental conditions than more distant ones. Third, closely related, ecologically similar species differ in no more than a very few niche dimensions. A more formal model can be developed that predicts that under these assumptions the distribution of population density over space should approximate a normal probability density distribution. Most exceptions to this predicted pattern can be explained as cases in which assumptions of the model are clearly violated. This paper represents an example of a statistical approach that should be useful for investigating complex ecological systems comprised of many components, such as species of many individuals or communities of many species. The general relationships between abundance and distribution developed here eventually should contribute to our understanding of the biogeography, population genetics, and evolution of species as well as the ecological attributes of populations and communities.},

     abstract = {Much of the coastal southeast Florida Peninsula is heavily urbanized, and many native environments have been destroyed or severely affected by urbanization. In an attempt to reconstruct potential natural environments, soil properties were used as a basis for recognizing prior landscapes. Pedological associations were adopted because they provided landscape features that were least modified by urbanization and they could be used as a unifying basis for categorization of native coastal environments. A geographic information system analysis ring was used for querying coverages for soil distribution patterns, vegetation, hydrology (drainage), topography, and geology. By simultaneously generalizing and recombining soil survey data, land use cover types, topography, and hydrology, it was possible to identify recurring patterns of soils, landforms, and vegetation. Results of this analysis produced 13 land systems with 25 subunits that included various types of lakebeds, tree islands, marshes, prairies, sloughs, sandplains, glades, marshlands, lagoons, estuaries, and beaches. The resulting map for potential natural environments in Palm Beach and Broward Counties complements conceptual ecological models for the Greater Florida Everglades Ecosystem, developed for the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan. The Australian land systems approach, as applied in this study, provides insight into coastal environments that lie outside of ecological models for mostly protected areas inland.},

     abstract = {In ecological field surveys, observations are gathered at different spatial locations. The purpose may be to relate biological response variables (e.g., species abundances) to explanatory environmental variables (e.g., soil characteristics). In the absence of prior knowledge, ecologists have been taught to rely on systematic or random sampling designs. If there is prior knowledge about the spatial patterning of the explanatory variables, obtained from either previous surveys or a pilot study, can we use this information to optimize the sampling design in order to maximize our ability to detect the relationships between the response and explanatory variables? The specific questions addressed in this paper are: a) What is the effect (type I error) of spatial autocorrelation on the statistical tests commonly used by ecologists to analyse field survey data? b) Can we eliminate, or at least minimize, the effect of spatial autocorrelation by the design of the survey? Are there designs that provide greater power for surveys, at least under certain circumstances? c) Can we eliminate or control for the effect of spatial autocorrelation during the analysis? To answer the last question, we compared regular regression analysis to a modified t-test developed by Dutilleul for correlation coefficients in the presence of spatial autocorrelation. Replicated surfaces (typically, 1000 of them) were simulated using different spatial parameters, and these surfaces were subjected to different sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis. The simulated surfaces may represent, for example, vegetation response to underlying environmental variation. This allowed us 1) to measure the frequency of type I error (the failure to reject the null hypothesis when in fact there is no effect of the environment on the response variable) and 2) to estimate the power of the different combinations of sampling designs and methods of statistical analysis (power is measured by the rate of rejection of the null hypothesis when an effect of the environment on the response variable has been created). Our results indicate that: 1) Spatial autocorrelation in both the response and environmental variables affects the classical tests of significance of correlation or regression coefficients. Spatial autocorrelation in only one of the two variables does not affect the test of significance. 2) A broad-scale spatial structure present in data has the same effect on the tests as spatial autocorrelation. When such a structure is present in one of the variables and autocorrelation is found in the other, or in both, the tests of significance have inflated rates of type I error. 3) Dutilleul's modified t-test for the correlation coefficient, corrected for spatial autocorrelation, effectively corrects for spatial autocorrelation in the data. It also effectively corrects for the presence of deterministic structures, with or without spatial autocorrelation. The presence of a broad-scale deterministic structure may, in some cases, reduce the power of the modified t-test.},

We used the adaptive local convex hull (a-LoCoH) method to map distribution ranges of 12 ungulate species within the Kruger National Park (KNP) based on locations recorded during aerial surveys (1980–1993). We used log-linear models to identify changes in regional distribution patterns and chi-square tests to determine shifts in habitat occupation over this period. We compared observed patterns with earlier, more subjectively derived distribution maps for these species. Zebra, wildebeest and giraffe distributions shifted towards the far northern section of the KNP, whilst buffalo and kudu showed proportional declines in the north. Sable antelope distribution contracted most in the north, whilst tsessebe, eland and roan antelope distributions showed no shifts. Warthog and waterbuck contracted in the central and northern regions, respectively. The distribution of impala did not change. Compared with earlier distributions, impala, zebra, buffalo, warthog and waterbuck had become less strongly concentrated along rivers. Wildebeest, zebra, sable antelope and  tsessebe had become less prevalent in localities west of the central region. Concerning habitat occupation, the majority of grazers showed a concentration on basaltic substrates, whilst sable antelope favoured mopane-dominated woodland and sour bushveld on granite. Buffalo showed no strong preference for any habitats and waterbuck were concentrated along rivers. Although widespread, impala were absent from sections of mopane shrubveld and sandveld. Kudu and giraffe were widespread through most habitats, but with a lesser prevalence in northern mopane-dominated habitats. Documented distribution shifts appeared to be related to the completion of the western boundary fence and widened provision of surface water within the park. Conservation implications: The objectively recorded distribution patterns provide a foundation for assessing future changes in distribution that may take place in response to climatic shifts or other influences.},

abstract = {Optimal diet selection of generalist mammalian herbivores under the influence of a digestion constraint is analyzed using an algebraic model. The energy assimilation rate and the digesta mass are first formulated based on an assumed intake process from multiple food types differing in digestible energy content and digestive turnover time. The optimal diet is then analyzed under the assumption that animals maximize energy assimilation under the constraint of digestive capacity. The analysis suggests that diet preference is changeable according to the intensity of the digestion constraint. With a better intake condition (longer foraging time or more abundant food), the digestion constraint is intensified and diet selection is more oriented towards the digestive process: diet is composed of a smaller number of food types of higher digestive quality (digestible energy content per gross intake per digestive turnover time). In contrast, with a loose digestion constraint, diet selection is more oriented towards the intake process: diet is composed of a larger number of food types of higher handling rate (digestible energy content per handling time). Because diet preference is thus changeable, a priori ranking of food types is not justified in digestion constrained herbivore foraging.},

* 1Rate-maximizing foragers that only divide their time between searching and handling prey should, according to the classical contingency model (CM), only select those prey whose energy content per unit handling time (i.e. profitability) exceeds or equals long-term average energy intake rate.
* 2However, if digestively constrained foragers were to follow this so-called âzero-one ruleâ, they would need to take digestive breaks and their energy intake over total time would not be maximized. They should, according to the digestive rate model (DRM), also consider the rate at which a prey type is digested (i.e. digestive quality), such that time lost to digestive breaks is minimized.
* 3In three different contexts, we tested these competing models in a mollusc-eating shorebird, the red knot (Calidris canutus), that is often digestively constrained due to its habit of ingesting its bulky prey whole. Measurements on gizzard size (using ultrasonography) and prey-characteristics confirmed that in each test the birds were digestively bottlenecked and should thus follow the DRM in order to maximize long-term energy intake.
* 4In the first experiment, knots were offered a choice between two fully exposed prey, and tended to select prey by the criterion of digestive quality rather than profitability.
* 5In the second experiment, knots were offered two buried prey types and preferred the highest quality prey to the most profitable prey.
* 6In the wild, knots mainly fed on high quality Mya and largely ignored poor quality, but equally profitable, Cerastoderma.
* 7Thus, each test verified the predictions of the DRM and rejected those of the CM. Given that many species face digestion constraints, we expect that the DRM is likely to explain diet composition in many more studies.},

In March-April islandica-knots predominantly use the intertidal flats in the western part of the Wadden Sea in The Netherlands (canutus is still in west Africa). In May both subspecies use the eastern part of the Wadden Sea in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany only. We studied these knots in core areas at both ends of the Wadden Sea in 1990, to examine whether the absence of knots in the western Wadden Sea in May is related to food resources or to other factors connected with the energy budget of these long-distance migrants. Islandica-knots in March-April in The Netherlands and canutus-knots in May in Germany had similar diets and showed similar size selection of their major bivalve prey Macoma balthica, giving the possibility for indirect competitive interactions. Knots spent more time feeding per day in Germany. The harvestable biomass of Macoma was of comparable magnitude in both parts of the Wadden Sea in May. That knots always leave the western Wadden Sea in late April is, therefore, not a direct response to prey depletion. If Macoma always subsides earlier in the year in the western part of the Wadden Sea than in the east as in 1990, the knots' absence in the west may represent the riding of an eastward wave of good feeding conditions resulting from longitudinal variation in bivalve-prey biology. At least for canutus, the reliance in May on the eastern Wadden Sea may (additionally?) represent early movements - at relatively low body masses - towards the breeding areas to gain the benefits of a small saving on the cost and time of travel, and of being closer to the weather systems that may help their flight into the breeding areas.},

It is assumed that birds will show a breakpoint in composition during starvation, because stores, the nutrients accumulated in anticipation of shortage, have a different composition from that of the structural part of the body. The models differ only in the assumptions on the sources of variation in the data. One model, for example, assumes that all variation is due to unexplained variation in the mass of the structural part of the body. Another model assumes that the only variation is in the composition of the stores. It is shown that these models may yield completely different results. Examples suggest that the most reliable assumption on the source of variation differs among bird species. The need for ancillary information to verify the assumptions is emphasized. Prevailing methods, such as regressing fat mass on body mass and size, or regressing fat mass on condition indices such as body mass divided by size, are shown to be based on questionable assumptions, or to lack any theoretical justification, respectively. Their use should be abandoned.},

A more general contingency model of optimal diet choice is developed, allowing for simultaneous searching and handling, which extends the theory to include grazing and browsing by large herbivores. 2. Foraging resolves into three modes: purely encounter-limited, purely handling-limited and mixed-process, in which either a handling-limited prey type is added to an encounter-limited diet, or the diet becomes handling-limited as it expands. 3. The purely encounter-limited diet is, in general, broader than that predicted by the conventional contingency model. 4. As the degree of simultaneity of searching and handling increases, the optimal diet expands to the point where it is handling-limited, at which point all inferior prey types are rejected. 5. Inclusion of a less profitable prey species is not necessarily independent of its encounter rate and the zero-one rule does not necessarily hold: some of the less profitable prey may be included in the optimal diet. This gives an optimal foraging explanation for herbivores' mixed diets. 6. Rules are shown for calculating the boundary between encounter-limited and handling-limited diets and for predicting the proportion of inferior prey to be included in a two-species diet. 7. The digestive rate model is modified to include simultaneous searching and handling, showing that the more they overlap, the more the predicted diet-breadth is likely to be reduced.},

If the variogram has been computed by the usual method of moments, it is likely to be unstable when there are fewer than 100 data. The scale of variation in soil properties should be investigated prior to sampling by computing a variogram from ancillary data, such as an aerial photograph of the bare soil. If the sampling interval suggested by this is large in relation to the size of the field there will be too few data to estimate a reliable variogram for kriging. Standardized variograms from aerial photographs can be used with standardized soil data that are sparse, provided the data are spatially structured and the nugget:sill ratio is similar to that of a reliable variogram of the property. The problem remains of how to set this ratio in the absence of an accurate variogram. Several methods of estimating the nugget:sill ratio for selected soil properties are proposed and evaluated. Standardized variograms with nugget:sill ratios set by these methods are more similar to those computed from intensive soil data than are variograms computed from sparse soil data. The results of cross-validation and mapping show that the standardized variograms provide more accurate estimates, and preserve the main patterns of variation better than those computed from sparse data.},

  abstract = {Whether intertidal areas are used to capacity by shorebirds can best be answered by large-scale manipulation of foraging areas. The recent overexploitation of benthic resources in the western Dutch Wadden Sea offers such an 'experimental' setting. 2. We review the effects of declining food abundances on red knot Calidris canutus islandica numbers, based on a yearly large-scale benthic mapping effort, long-term colour-ringing and regular bird-counts from 1996 to 2005. We focus on the three-way relationships between suitable foraging area, the spatial predictability of food and red knot survival.  3. For each benthic sampling position, red knot intake rate (mg AFDM s-1) was predicted by a multiple prey species functional response model, based on digestive rate maximization (this model explained diet and intake rate in earlier studies on red knots). This enabled us to derive the spatial distribution of the suitable foraging area, which in each of the 10 years was analysed with a measure of autocorrelation, i.e. Moran's I. 4. Over the 10 years, when accounting for a threshold value to meet energetic demands, red knots lost 55\% of their suitable foraging area. This ran parallel to a decrease in red knot numbers by 42\%. Although there was also a decrease in patchiness (i.e. less information about the location of the suitable feeding sites), this did not yet lead to additional loss of birds. 5. To cope with these landscape-scale declines in food stocks, an increase in the capacity for instantaneous food processing would be required. Although we show that red knots indeed enlarged their muscular gizzards, the increase in gizzard size was not enough to compensate for the decreased feeding area. 6. Survival of islandica knots in the western Dutch Wadden Sea, based on colour-ring resightings, declined from 89\% in the first half of our study period to 82\% in the second half of our study period and could account for almost half of the decline in red knot numbers; the rest must have moved elsewhere in winter. 7.  Densities of red knots per unit suitable foraging area remained constant at 10 knots ha-1 between 1996 and 2005, which suggests that red knots have been using the Dutch Wadden Sea to full capacity.}

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.}

The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in  only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the MatÃ©rn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of , between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.}

Their main challenge focusses around computation, but the advent of Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC) and in particular of the WinBUGS software has opened the doors of Bayesian modelling to the wide research community. However model complexity and database dimension still remain a constraint. Recently the use of Gaussian random fields has become increasingly popular in epidemiology as very often epidemiological data are characterised by a spatial and/or temporal structure which needs to be taken into account in the inferential process. The Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) approach has been developed as a computationally efficient alternative to MCMC and the availability of an R package (R-INLA) allows researchers to easily apply this method. In this paper we review the INLA approach and present some applications on spatial and spatio-temporal data."

abstract = {1. Knots Calidris canutus are high-arctic breeding shorebirds which spend the non-breeding season in intertidal areas where they feed on small buried molluscs which are swallowed whole. We tested whether their intake rate can be adequately described by a functional response model (the disc equation of Holling) assuming prey detection by direct touch. 2. Knots were fed two bivalve species (Macoma balthica and Cerastoderma edule) of different size and at different density and in Macoma at variable depth on small areas of soft sediment. Five different individuals were used in feeding trials during which six prey were allowed detection and ingestion. 3. Knots perfectly obeyed the two basic assumptions of Holling's disc equation: neither the instantaneous area of discovery nor the handling time changed with variation in prey density. 4. However, two predictions for prey perception by direct touch (that the instantaneous area of discovery is a positive function of shell size and a negative one of prey depth) were rejected. The instantaneous area of discovery was usually also higher than predicted from the area touched by probing knots. 5. Knots may, therefore, use a `remote sense' to locate buried hard-shelled prey. Gerritsen, van Heezik \& Swennen (1983) showed that knots do not use taste to discover bivalves at a distance. We argue that the detection involves a self-induced pressure mechanism rather than a passive sense for vibrations, since it is unlikely that static bivalve prey emit such signals just after experimental handling. 6. Whatever the exact prey detection mechanism, the recorded (high) value for the instantaneous area of discovery of deep-living bivalve prey is in accord with the observation that knots use large areas of intertidal flat in the western Dutch Wadden Sea where bivalve stocks are too low to support knots according to a previous functional response model invoking direct touch.},

It assumes that with probability p the only possible observation is 0, and with probability 1 - p, a Poisson(Î») random variable is observed. For example, when manufacturing equipment is properly aligned, defects may be nearly impossible. But when it is misaligned, defects may occur according to a Poisson(Î») distribution. Both the probability p of the perfect, zero defect state and the mean number of defects Î» in the imperfect state may depend on covariates. Sometimes p and Î» are unrelated; other times p is a simple function of Î» such as p=1/(1+Î» <sup>Ï</sup>) for an unknown constant Ï. In either case, ZIP regression models are easy to fit. The maximum likelihood estimates (MLE's) are approximately normal in large samples, and confidence intervals can be constructed by inverting likelihood ratio tests or using the approximate normality of the MLE's. Simulations suggest that the confidence intervals based on likelihood ratio tests are better, however. Finally, ZIP regression models are not only easy to interpret, but they can also lead to more refined data analyses. For example, in an experiment concerning soldering defects on printed wiring boards, two sets of conditions gave about the same mean number of defects, but the perfect state was more likely under one set of conditions and the mean number of defects in the imperfect state was smaller under the other set of conditions; that is, ZIP regression can show not only which conditions give lower mean number of defects but also why the means are lower.},

A dataset of radionuclide concentrations on Rongelap Island is used to illustrate the techniques. For this dataset we demonstrate that the log-link function is not a good choice, and that there exists additional nonspatial variation which cannot be attributed to the Poisson error distribution. We also show that the interpretation of this additional variation as either micro-scale variation or measurement error has a significant impact on predictions.

We describe two spatial applications for which Gaussian distributional assumptions are clearly inappropriate. The first concerns the assessment of residual contamination from nuclear weapons testing on a South Pacific island, in which the sampling method generates spatially indexed Poisson counts conditional on an unobserved spatially varying intensity of radioactivity; we conclude that a conventional geostatistical analysis oversmooths the data and underestimates the spatial extremes of the intensity. The second application provides a description of spatial variation in the risk of campylobacter infections relative to other enteric infections in part of north Lancashire and south Cumbria. For this application, we treat the data as binomial counts at unit postcode locations, conditionally on an unobserved relative risk surface which we estimate. The theoretical framework for our extension of geostatistical methods is that, conditionally on the unobserved process S(x), observations at sample locations x<sub>i</sub> form a generalized linear model with the corresponding values of S(x<sub>i</sub>) appearing as an offset term in the linear predictor. We use a Bayesian inferential framework, implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo method, to solve the prediction problem for non-linear functionals of S(x), making a proper allowance for the uncertainty in the estimation of any model parameters.},

abstract = {Species distributional or trait data based on range map (extent-of-occurrence) or atlas survey data often display spatial autocorrelation, i.e. locations close to each other exhibit more similar values than those further apart. If this pattern remains present in the residuals of a statistical model based on such data, one of the key assumptions of standard statistical analyses, that residuals are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d), is violated. The violation of the assumption of i.i.d. residuals may bias parameter estimates and can increase type I error rates (falsely rejecting the null hypothesis of no effect). While this is increasingly recognised by researchers analysing species distribution data, there is, to our knowledge, no comprehensive overview of the many available spatial statistical methods to take spatial autocorrelation into account in tests of statistical significance. Here, we describe six different statistical approaches to infer correlates of species distributions, for both presence/absence (binary response) and species abundance data (poisson or normally distributed response), while accounting for spatial autocorrelation in model residuals: autocovariate regression; spatial eigenvector mapping; generalised least squares; (conditional and simultaneous) autoregressive models and generalised estimating equations. A comprehensive comparison of the relative merits of these methods is beyond the scope of this paper. To demonstrate each method's implementation, however, we undertook preliminary tests based on simulated data. These preliminary tests verified that most of the spatial modeling techniques we examined showed good type I error control and precise parameter estimates, at least when confronted with simplistic simulated data containing spatial autocorrelation in the errors. However, we found that for presence/absence data the results and conclusions were very variable between the different methods. This is likely due to the low information content of binary maps. Also, in contrast with previous studies, we found that autocovariate methods consistently underestimated the effects of environmental controls of species distributions. Given their widespread use, in particular for the modelling of species presence/absence data (e.g. climate envelope models), we argue that this warrants further study and caution in their use. To aid other ecologists in making use of the methods described, code to implement them in freely available software is provided in an electronic appendix.}

In many applications, prediction of random effects in a spatial GLMM is of great practical interest. We show that the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) prediction can be done in a linear fashion in spatial GLMMs analogous to linear kriging. We develop a Monte Carlo version of the EM gradient algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters. A by-product of this approach is that it also produces the MMSE estimates for the realized random effects at the sampled sites. This method is illustrated through a simulation study and is also applied to a real data set on plant root diseases to obtain a map of disease severity that can facilitate the practice of precision agriculture.},

abstract = {Relationships between species abundance and occupancy are of considerable interest in metapopulation biology and in macroecology. Such relationships may be described concisely using probability models that characterize variation in abundance of a species. However, estimation of the parameters of these models in most ecological problems is impaired by imperfect detection. When organisms are detected imperfectly, observed counts are biased estimates of true abundance, and this induces bias in stated occupancy or occurrence probability. In this paper we consider a class of models that enable estimation of abundance/occupancy relationships from counts of organisms that result from surveys in which detection is imperfect. Under such models, parameter estimation and inference are based on conventional likelihood methods. We provide an application of these models to geographically extensive breeding bird survey data in which alternative models of abundance are considered that include factors that influence variation in abundance and detectability. Using these models, we produce estimates of abundance and occupancy maps that honor important sources of spatial variation in avian abundance and provide clearly interpretable characterizations of abundance and occupancy adjusted for imperfect detection.},

abstract = {1.âEcological count data typically exhibit complexities such as overdispersion and zero-inflation, and are often weakly associated with a relatively large number of correlated covariates. The use of an appropriate statistical model for inference is therefore essential. A common selection criteria for choosing between nested models is the likelihood ratio test (LRT). Widely used alternatives to the LRT are based on information-theoretic metrics such as the Akaike Information Criterion.2.âIt is widely believed that the LRT can only be used to compare the performance of nested models â i.e. in situations where one model is a special case of another. There are many situations in which it is important to compare non-nested models, so, if true, this would be a substantial drawback of using LRTs for model comparison. In reality, however, it is actually possible to use the LRT for comparing both nested and non-nested models. This fact is well-established in the statistical literature, but not widely used in ecological studies.3.âThe main obstacle to the use of the LRT with non-nested models has, until relatively recently, been the fact that it is difficult to explicitly write down a formula for the distribution of the LRT statistic under the null hypothesis that one of the models is true. With modern computing power it is possible to overcome this difficulty by using a simulation-based approach.4.âTo demonstrate the practical application of the LRT to both nested and non-nested model comparisons, a case study involving data on questing tick (Ixodes ricinus) abundance is presented. These data contain complexities typical in ecological analyses, such as zero-inflation and overdispersion, for which comparison between models of differing structure â e.g. non-nested models â is of particular importance.5.âChoosing between competing statistical models is an essential part of any applied ecological analysis. The LRT is a standard statistical test for comparing nested models. By use of simulation the LRT can also be used in an analogous fashion to compare non-nested models, thereby providing a unified approach for model comparison within the null hypothesis testing paradigm. A simple practical guide is provided in how to apply this approach to the key models required in the analyses of count data.}

    abstract = { Species distribution models (SDMs) are numerical tools that combine observations of species occurrence or abundance with environmental estimates. They are used to gain ecological and evolutionary insights and to predict distributions across landscapes, sometimes requiring extrapolation in space and time. SDMs are now widely used across terrestrial, freshwater, and marine realms. Differences in methods between disciplines reflect both differences in species mobility and in an established use. Model realism and robustness is influenced by selection of relevant predictors and modeling method, consideration of scale, how the interplay between environmental and geographic factors is handled, and the extent of extrapolation. Current linkages between SDM practice and ecological theory are often weak, hindering progress. Remaining challenges include: improvement of methods for modeling presence-only data and for model selection and evaluation; accounting for biotic interactions; and assessing model uncertainty. }

* Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), which collect images of marine habitats, are now an established sampling tool. The use of AUVs is becoming more widespread as they offer a non-destructive method to survey substantial spatial areas. The design of AUV surveys has historically been based on expert knowledge and AUV-specific considerations, such as reducing geolocation error. The expert knowledge encompasses intuition, previous surveying experiences and holistic knowledge of the study region.
* We investigate the statistical aspects to AUV survey design for estimation of percentage cover of key benthic biota. We investigate the presence of spatial autocorrelation in AUV data using model-based geostatistics and examine the effect of autocorrelation on survey design by examining different design strategies â methods for placing AUV transects. The design strategies are assessed by inspecting the expected bias and the expected standard deviation of model predictions, where the model depends on the choice of design.
* The AUV data exhibited a wide range of autocorrelation, from non-existent to substantial. The design strategies varied in their statistical performance and nearly all strategies had shortcomings. Design strategies that were consistently poor performers had (i) transects placed in parallel in a single spatial dimension and (ii) made no attempt to spread out the transects in space. The superior design types had more transect-to-transect separation (but not too much) and effectively spanned important covariates.
* The results give guidelines to researchers designing AUV surveys for biological mapping and for monitoring. In particular, we demonstrate that any spatial design should seek spatial balance, such as would be introduced by a systematic or stratified component within a randomized design. Knowledge of the system under study should be incorporated and, if possible, should be done so in a formal manner that is objective and repeatable.

abstract = {
To design an efficient survey or monitoring program for a natural resource it is important to consider the spatial distribution of the resource. Generally, sample designs that are spatially balanced are more efficient than designs which are not. A spatially balanced design selects a sample that is evenly distributed over the extent of the resource. In this article we present a new spatially balanced design that can be used to select a sample from discrete and continuous populations in multi-dimensional space. The design, which we call balanced acceptance sampling, utilizes the Halton sequence to assure spatial diversity of selected locations. Targeted inclusion probabilities are achieved by acceptance sampling. The BAS design is conceptually simpler than competing spatially balanced designs, executes faster, and achieves better spatial balance as measured by a number of quantities. The algorithm has been programed in an R package freely available for download.

abstract = "Abstract The effect of the persistence of spatial patterns on the performance of space-time sampling designs is explored by a simulation study. The performance is evaluated on the basis of the covariance matrix of the two parameters (intercept and slope) of a linear model for the change over time of the spatial means or totals. The evaluated sampling approach is hybrid, i.e. design-based estimation of spatial means from spatial probability samples is combined with time-series modelling of the spatial means. A simulation algorithm is presented for approximating the covariance matrix of the time-series model parameters from a full space-time model. Designs were evaluated on the basis of the determinant of this matrix and the variance of the estimated trend parameter. As a space-time model a sum-metric space-time variogram is used, the parameters of which are chosen such that the persistence of spatial patterns varies from nearly absent to very strong. Based on the extensive simulations, recommendations on the type of space-time design can most easily be made for situations with either very strong or no persistence of spatial patterns. With strong persistence the supplemented panel (SuP) design is recommendable. With no persistence the independent-synchronous (IS) and serially alternating (SA) designs are the best choice. These designs performed well with regard to both quality criteria. With moderate persistence of spatial patterns the choice of design type is more complicated. The \{IS\} and static-synchronous (SS) design performed best on one quality criterion, but worst on the other. Therefore, with moderate pattern persistence, the compromise designs, either SuP or SA, can be a good choice, unless one of the two quality criteria has priority. An R script is provided for ex ante evaluation of space–time designs in real-world applications. "

Artificial data based on explicit theory can be used as truth. Statistical models should be capable of recovering truth if they are to be useful when applied to field data. Use of artificial data in plant community ecology to evaluate statistical methods is reviewed. Two plant community theoretical models based on the continuum concept are identified for describing species responses, the Swan/ter Braak model (Gaussian symmetric unimodal responses) and the Ellenberg/Minchin model (skewed unimodal responses). Theory regarding both indirect and direct environmental gradients is used to simulate a realistic species/environment data set. The software package \{COMPAS\} with a restricted set of options is used to generate two types of data set: (1) direct, where species show typical responses to variables such as radiation and (2) indirect, where variables like aspect and slope which are related to radiation by complex environmental processes. An example of generalised linear models (GLM) and generalised additive models (GAM) applied to the artificial data sets by analysts unaware of truth is presented. The results are evaluated on the following criteria: correct selection of predictors; accurate description of response curves; prediction of abundance; and ecologically rational relationships. The potential impacts of differences in the skills of the analysts are discussed. Both \{GLM\} and \{GAM\} performed well with Gaussian responses and direct gradient predictors. \{GAM\} performed marginally better with the skewed response model and direct predictors. \{GAM\} performed consistently better than \{GLM\} with the indirect predictors. The main conclusion was that the ecological knowledge and statistical skills of the analysts were more important than the method used. "

It is understood to arise at genetic, species and multiple levels of community organisation, hence is multidimensional in nature. Biodiversity indices have proliferated in attempts to capture this complexity but may now have confounded it. Here we attempt a reduction to the minimal set of metrics needed to describe biodiversity (often by default taken to be species richness). 1000 model communities with realistic taxonomic composition were synthesised using databases of marine benthic species. A battery of 19 biodiversity indices were calculated for every community and analysed by \{PCA\} to show inter-dependence and sensitivity to variation in taxonomic (a surrogate for genetic), functional (based on ecological roles) and structural (based on species abundance) diversity. We found the three major axes of biodiversity were (a) structural complexity, and (b) two different mixtures of taxonomic and functional diversity: it was well approximated by a three-dimensional space of these variables. A scalar distance from the origin of this space could serve as a single valued summary where needed, for example in economic valuations. The most widely used single biodiversity measure -- species richnes -- missed 88.6\% of the diversity, emphasising the importance of additional characters and the need for species databases to record functional traits, presence and abundance in communities, and phylogenetic information.

It couples the fitting of single hyperbolic functions to trap data with the use of a 'nested-cross array', a cross-shaped trap arrangement with distances between traps doubling with increasing distance from the central trap. 2. We used individual-based simulation modelling to test the method's reliability given changes in population density, turning rate, trapping period, beetle distribution and intertrap distance. 3. Simulations show that function fits are more likely, and density estimates more accurate, with greater body size and therefore with net displacement, increasing population density, decreasing aggregation and increased turning rate. 4. Simulation indicates that the method is a promising procedure for density estimation that is worth testing in the field. Reliable density estimates are possible if the traps contain a neutral preservative, arrays are established in nearly homogeneous parts of habitat and the arms of the nested-cross array are distant from habitat edges.},

Three different types of subsampling designs (random, systematic and systematic-cluster) with small sample sizes (50 and 64 points), obtained from this larger data set (200 points), are evaluated. The sensitivity of the spatial methods in the detection and the reconstruction of spatial patterns following the application of the various subsampling designs is discussed. We find that the type of sampling design plays an important role in the capacity of autocorrelation coefficients to detect significant spatial autocorrelation, and in the ability to accurately reconstruct spatial patterns by kriging.
