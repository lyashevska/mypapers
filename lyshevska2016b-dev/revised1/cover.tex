\opening{Dear Professor Stein,}

We are grateful for the very useful review of our manuscript which you recently supplied. We have followed it to revise our work which we now offer for consideration as a revised manuscript. 
While addressing issues raised by the first reviewer we discovered an error in the procedure which is now corrected. All results were updated. 

We are very grateful for your attention.

Yours sincerely,
