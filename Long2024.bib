abstract = {The jellyfish Pelagia noctiluca form extensive aggregations in the Mediterranean Sea that can exert top-down control on prey and cause mass-mortalities in fish farms. The description of extensive aggregations of P. noctiluca in the northeast Atlantic in 2007 coupled with a subsequent mortality event of farmed salmon in Northern Ireland prompted further investigation of the species in this region. We collected standardised P. noctiluca biomass from 1938 fisheries trawls over 11 years (2008–2018) covering ∼200,000 km2 of northeast Atlantic shelf seas. While a linear trend in P. noctiluca was not identified, the mean annual biomass exhibited significant fluctuations, with particularly elevated levels in 2009, 2013, 2014 and 2016 (0.05, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.02 kg ha−1, respectively). Mean biomass was higher in the northern (0.028 kg ha−1) and western portions (0.005 kg ha−1) of the study area compared to the southwestern (0.003 kg ha−1) and southeastern portions (0.001 kg ha−1). A binomial generalised linear mixed model of P. noctiluca biomass data indicated that higher P. noctiluca occurrence was driven by a positive Eastern Atlantic Pattern index (strongest effect), south-easterly winds, a negative North Atlantic Oscillation index and lower sea-surface temperatures (weakest effect). The fixed effects accounted for 36.81% of the variance in P. noctiluca occurrence data, while a random year effect further explained an additional 24.06% of the variance. These conditions may destabilise the European Slope Current in autumn-winter which promotes the transport of P. noctiluca from oceanic sources onto the northeast Atlantic shelf. Our findings represent a dramatic shift in our understanding of this species in the northeast Atlantic which may have significant ecological impacts, from predation on fish eggs and larvae to providing food for oceanic sunfish.}
